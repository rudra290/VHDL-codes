    <h1>VHDL Projects and Exercises - NPTEL Workshop, IIT Bombay</h1>
    <p>This repository contains VHDL codes developed during the NPTEL workshop on Digital System Design at IIT Bombay in June 2024. It includes problems, homework assignments, quizzes, and a final project, all aimed at enhancing understanding and practical skills in VHDL.</p>
    
    <h2>Contents:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Problems:</strong> Coding challenges covering key VHDL concepts in digital circuit design.</li>
        <li><strong>Homework Assignments:</strong> Exercises focused on applying VHDL constructs and design techniques.</li>
        <li><strong>Quizzes:</strong> Short assessments to test knowledge of VHDL syntax, logic design, and implementation.</li>
        <li><strong>Project:</strong> A comprehensive VHDL project, such as a Traffic Light Controller using a CPLD board, demonstrating real-world application.</li>
    </ul>
