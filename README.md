<h1>VHDL Projects and Exercises - NPTEL Workshop, IIT Bombay</h1>
This repository contains VHDL codes developed during the NPTEL workshop on Digital System Design at IIT Bombay in June 2024. It includes problems, homework assignments, quizzes, and a final project, all aimed at enhancing understanding and practical skills in VHDL.

Contents:
Problems: Coding challenges covering key VHDL concepts in digital circuit design.
Homework Assignments: Exercises focused on applying VHDL constructs and design techniques.
Quizzes: Short assessments to test knowledge of VHDL syntax, logic design, and implementation.
Project: A comprehensive VHDL project, such as a Traffic Light Controller using a CPLD board, demonstrating real-world application.
Highlights:
Reference Material: Ideal for students and professionals to reference for VHDL design.
Wide Coverage: Includes a range of topics from basic logic gates to advanced state machines.
Practical Focus: Emphasizes real-world applications to connect theory with practice.
Usage:
Clone the repository.
Explore and run the VHDL codes using your preferred VHDL simulator.
Use the solutions as a reference for your own VHDL projects or studies.
